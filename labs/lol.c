ok, so #include <stuff.h> is a weird edge case


//this is a silly1 
//c program
// please to ignore
//this is a si2lly 
//this is a si3lly 
//this is a si4lly 
//this is a si5lly 
//this is a si6lly 
//this is a si7lly 
//this is a si8lly 
/* other things to
 * ignore for reals*/
#include "wat.h"
why are you ignoring
this will probably work
this line will probably repeat


                                                                             
 ""#                                                       "    #            
   #     mmm    mmm    mmm   m   m   mmm          mmmmm  mmm    #   m   mmm  
   #    #" "#  #" "#  #" "#  "m m"  #"  #         # # #    #    # m"   #"  # 
   #    #   #  #   #  #   #   #m#   #""""         # # #    #    #"#    #"""" 
   "mm  "#m#"  "#m#"  "#m#"    #    "#mm"         # # #  mm#mm  #  "m  "#mm"
